## Trading Prediction Analysis: 
 
### Tuning the Baseline Trading Algorithm
* Slicing data into different periods:

### Baseline Predictions: 
#### Slow SMA window = 4 / Fast SMA window = 100 / Training Data Window = 3 months

### 2 Month Slice Predictions:
#### Slow SMA window = 4 / Fast SMA window = 100 / Training Data Window = 2 months

### 7 Month Slice Predictions:
#### Slow SMA window = 4 / Fast SMA window = 100 / Training Data Window = 7 months

### Question/Answer:
### What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?
#### 2 month slice:

Decreasing the training window to 2 months did not have any significant impact on the results. The accuaracy remained at 55% and the recall values did not change. The precision value however for a sell position reduced from 43% to 39%

#### 7 Month slice:

Increasing the training window to 7 months did increase the accuracy 1% from 55% to 56%. The recall value for a buy postition decreased by 1% from 96% to 95% and for the sell position increased by 1% from 4% to 5%. The precision value for the buy position stayed the same however for the sell position it increased by 2% from 43% to 45%. 

We do see an improvment in the prediction model by increasing the training window.

## Tuning the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features. 
* Adjusting one or both of the windows for the algorithm.

### Slow SMA window = 30 / Fast SMA window = 180 / Training Data window = 3 months:

### Slow SMA window = 5 / Fast SMA window = 60 / Training Data window = 3 months:

### Question/Answer:
### What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

#### Slow SMA window = 30 / Fast SMA window = 180:



#### Slow SMA window = 5 / Fast SMA window = 60
